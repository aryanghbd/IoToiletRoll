# IoToiletRoll - A toilet roll driven by IoT-technology to serve the family unit.
=============================

This repository contains all modules and files developed as part of this project, which was made in contribution to the Embedded Systems module at Imperial College London.

The IoToiletRoll, or IoTP, is a toilet roll powered by IoT that allows a family unit to track, conserve and visualise their toilet roll usage. In an age of hoarding and soaring costs of living, a trip to the toilet can result in a costlier trip to the supermarket! To get a better grip on our paper consumption and environmental footprint, we leverage a sleek toilet roll design with an embedded sensor-subsystem, driven by the Raspberry Pi, in order to opaquely track the rolls used per customer. We dynamically serve a MERN webapp in order to set up family accounts and come with custom additional features such as optional dynamic meme generation from serving an API, because he who rolls fast, rolls last!
